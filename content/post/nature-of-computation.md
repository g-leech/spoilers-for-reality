This view - natural computation, the ineliminable value of algorithmics - is not mainstream yet, but also not mad. Long, long interventions by Deutsch and Penrose and Aaronson. 

It is my impression that computer science is still low-status, tainted by its gigantic commercial importance. You can get evidence for this by how obscure the greats are in general, even by comparison to mathematicians and statisticians, and by how begrudgingly they are included in survey courses or the "philosophies of x".

# Chapter 1 


You can see why the intractability of Hamiltonians is so provocative to nerds. It's such a simple puzzle, it just seems *obvious* that it should have a simple substructure.

CS as the mathematics of (problem-solving) difficulty. I had my own go at enumerating, but maybe I need
